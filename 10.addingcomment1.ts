//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
//first program  
                        // odd numbers
let num = 27; //  choose any odd number and store it to in a variable
if (num % 2 !== 0) {
    console.log((num + " is a odd number ")); // then perform if condition  
} 



//second program name is even numbers

 num = 22; //  choose any even number and redeclear it in a variable

if(num % 2 === 0){
    console.log(`${num} is even`);   // then perform if condition  

}
